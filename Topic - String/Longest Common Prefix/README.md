# Longest Common Prefix

```Arr = ["aa" , "aab" , "aabvde"]```

## Problem Description

Given the array of strings A, you need to find the longest string S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.
Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.

For Example: longest common prefix of `"abcdefgh"` and `"abcefgh"` is `"abc"`.
